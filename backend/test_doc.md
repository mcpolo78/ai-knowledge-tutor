# Artificial Intelligence Basics

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI**: Designed to perform specific tasks (current AI systems)
2. **General AI**: Theoretical AI that could understand and perform any intellectual task
3. **Superintelligence**: AI that surpasses human intelligence in all areas

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from data patterns.

## Key Applications
- Healthcare diagnostics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommendation systems
